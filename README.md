# UBS Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

---

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Geist, a new font family for Vercel.

UBS Frontend Manual Deployment Guide (Azure App Service)
This guide explains how to manually deploy the static frontend of the UBS Final Year Project to Azure App Service.

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed locally

Azure CLI installed and logged in

Azure App Service created (Linux or Windows OS)

out/ folder containing the built static site (generated by npm run build or next export)

Step 1: Build the Static Frontend
bash
Copy code
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Export static files to the 'out' folder
npm run export
The out/ folder should now contain index.html, _next/, and other static assets.

Step 2: Create a ZIP of the Static Files
bash
Copy code
cd out
zip -r ../out-deploy.zip .
cd ..
out-deploy.zip will be used for deployment. Make sure the contents of out/ are at the root of the zip, not the folder itself.

Step 3: Deploy via Azure CLI
bash
Copy code
az webapp deploy \
  --resource-group UBS-Final-Year-Project \
  --name ubs-fyp-frontend \
  --src-path out-deploy.zip \
  --type zip
Wait a few minutes for the deployment to complete.

Check your site at https://<your-app-name>.azurewebsites.net.

Step 4: Verify Deployment
Refresh the web app URL.

The site should display your static frontend.

If you see “Web app is running but we don’t have your content yet,” check that the zip contains the contents of out/ at the root, not the folder itself.
